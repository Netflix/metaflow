# Dolt in Metaflow 


## Background 
Dolt is a SQL database with Git-like version control semantics for both data and schema. This folder contains demo code showing how to use the Dolt datatool inside Metaflow to get the benefits of Dolt's version control features.

## Goals
Assuming we have an instance of Dolt, in which we are storing some input data, and perhaps writing intermediate results to, we would like to do the following:
- given a Flow definition, stage, and run, succinctly retrieve the exact Dolt data used as input
- given a set of Flows, and one or more runs associated with each, easily verify they used the same input data
- given a Flow, a and a set of associated runs, succinctly obtain the data output to Dolt by each run
