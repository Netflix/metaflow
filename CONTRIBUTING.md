# Community

### Code style

We use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a code formatter. The easiest way to ensure your commits are always formatted with the correct version of `black` it is to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): install it and then run `pre-commit install` once in your local copy of the repo.

We also follow the [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) docstring style to enable automatic documentation using [nbdoc](https://github.com/outerbounds/nbdoc).
