## Component Details

The Core Workflow Engine is the central component responsible for defining, parsing, executing, and deploying Metaflow workflows. It manages the flow graph, individual task execution, and integrates with various runtime environments. It encompasses components for flow definition, graph management, native execution, worker process management, subprocess orchestration, overall flow orchestration, notebook integration, and deployment.

### Flow Definition (FlowSpec)
The Flow Definition (FlowSpec) component is the foundational class for defining Metaflow workflows. Users inherit from FlowSpec to structure their flows, declare parameters, and define step transitions. It processes configuration decorators, manages constants, and provides mechanisms for navigating the flow graph, including `next()` for step transitions and `merge_artifacts()` for data handling in join steps. It also supports parallel execution through integration with `UnboundedForeachInput`.

### Flow Graph Management
This component is responsible for constructing and representing the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of a Metaflow flow. It parses the flow definition to identify steps and their transitions, enabling visualization and traversal of the flow's structure. It provides core functionalities for creating nodes and traversing the graph, and its output is utilized by various orchestrators.

### Native Workflow Execution
This component handles the local execution of Metaflow workflows. It manages the entire lifecycle of individual tasks, including their creation, persistence of constants, and execution. It coordinates with worker process management for task launching and monitoring, handles retries for failed workers, and integrates with the data store for artifact management.

### Worker Process Management
This component is dedicated to launching, managing, and monitoring individual worker processes responsible for executing flow steps. It sets up the execution environment for each worker, including command-line arguments and tracing variables, manages logging output, and ensures proper process termination and resource cleanup, leveraging OS-specific process polling mechanisms.

### Subprocess Orchestration
This component provides a robust and generalized mechanism for executing external commands as subprocesses. It handles the creation, continuous monitoring, and graceful termination of these processes, including signal handling (e.g., SIGINT). It also manages the streaming and emission of logs from subprocesses and ensures proper resource cleanup, serving as a fundamental layer for both workflow execution and deployment.

### Flow Execution Orchestrator
This high-level component orchestrates the overall execution of Metaflow flows. It interacts with the subprocess orchestration system to run flow commands, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous execution. It manages the retrieval of execution results and provides necessary cleanup mechanisms for resources utilized during a flow run. It also serves as the base for specialized execution environments like the Notebook Runner.

### Workflow Deployment Framework
This component offers a comprehensive set of utilities and classes for deploying Metaflow flows to various external orchestrators and environments. It encompasses functionalities for managing temporary files and directories, handling process execution timeouts, and preparing command-line arguments for lower-level deployment processes. It provides the foundational support for creating and managing deployment-related subprocesses and serves as a base for specific deployers, including notebook-based deployments.
