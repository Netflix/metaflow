# GSoC Contributor Guidance for Metaflow

## Application Requirements

When submitting your application, please include a brief CV along with answers to the following questions:

1. What interests you most about Metaflow, and why do you want to contribute to it?

2. How can we, as mentors and project coordinators, get the best out of you?

## Proposal

If you're applying to one of our listed project ideas, put together a detailed, weekly schedule
with clear milestones and deliverables for each phase of the project. Include a high-level system
design and a breakdown of the key modules you plan to work on.

If you want to propose your own idea, include an outline of the project, the goals you're aiming
for, and the same kind of weekly schedule. Talk to the mentors or org admins before submitting so
they can point you toward the right project fit.

Submit your application to `help@metaflow.org` with the subject as **[GSOC 2026 Proposal]: Your Name**. 

## Metaflow-Specific Requirements

On top of the above, we expect the following from applicants:

- **Dev environment setup**:
  Show us that your environment is working. A screenshot of a successful run in the Metaflow UI
  is a good way to do this.

- **Community engagement**:
  Join the Metaflow Slack channel and look through the project ideas page. That's where you'll
  find mentors and discuss potential projects.

- **A solid proposal**:
  Put real thought into your proposal. We read them carefully, and a well-designed one stands out.

- **A starter PR**:
  Open a pull request on a good starter issue on the Metaflow GitHub repo. If it gets merged,
  that's a strong signal.
