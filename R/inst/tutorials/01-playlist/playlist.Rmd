PlayListFlow is a movie playlist generator, and this notebook shows how you can use the Metaflow client to access data from the versioned Metaflow runs. In this example, you can view all the historical playlists.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(metaflow))
message("Current metadata provider: ", get_metadata())
message("Current namespace: ", get_namespace())
```

## Print your latest generated playlist
```{r}
flow <- flow_client$new("PlayListFlow")

run_id <- flow$latest_successful_run
message("Using run: ", run_id)

run <- run_client$new(flow, run_id)

message("Bonus pick: ", run$artifact("bonus"))

message("Playlist generated on ", run$finished_at)
message("Playlist for movies in genre: ", run$artifact("genre"))

playlist <- run$artifact("playlist")
print(head(playlist))
```
