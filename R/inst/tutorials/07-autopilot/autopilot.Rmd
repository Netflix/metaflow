**This notebook shows how you can track Metaflow flows that have been scheduled to execute in the cloud.**

## Import the metaflow client
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(metaflow))
message("Current metadata provider: ", metaflow::get_metadata())
```

## Plot a timeline view of a scheduled run of MovieStatsFlow
When you triggered your flow on AWS Step Functions using `step-functions trigger`, you would have seen an output similar to - 
```{bash}
...
Workflow MovieStatsFlow triggered on AWS Step Functions (run-id sfn-dolor-sit-amet).
...
```
Paste the run-id below (run_id = 'sfn-dolor-sit-amet') and run the following after the run finishes on Step Function.
```{r}
set_namespace(NULL)
run = flow_client$new('MovieStatsFlow')$run('sfn-dolor-sit-amet')
print(run$steps)
```

## Steps View
```{r}
for (step_name in run$steps){
  step = run$step(step_name)
  step$summary()
}
```
