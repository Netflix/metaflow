    This class works as a context manager, calling `cleanup()` to remove
    temporary files at exit.

    show_output : bool, default True

    profile : str, optional, default None

        profile is used (or the one already set using `METAFLOW_PROFILE`)
    env : Dict[str, str], optional, default None
        Additional environment variables to set for the Run. This overrides the
        environment set for this process.
    cwd : str, optional, default None
        The directory to run the subprocess in; if not specified, the current
