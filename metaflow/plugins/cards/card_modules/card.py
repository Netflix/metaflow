class MetaflowCard(object):
    """
    Metaflow cards derive from this base class.

    Subclasses of this class are called *card types*. The desired card
    type `T` is defined in the `@card` decorator as `@card(type=T)`.

    After a task with `@card(type=T, options=S)` finishes executing, Metaflow instantiates
    a subclass `C` of `MetaflowCard` that has its `type` attribute set to `T`, i.e. `C.type=T`.
    The constructor is given the options dictionary `S` that contains arbitrary
    JSON-encodable data that is passed to the instance, parameterizing the card. The subclass
    may override the constructor to capture and process the options.

    The subclass needs to implement a `render(task)` method that produces the card
    contents in HTML, given the finished task that is represented by a `Task` object.

    Attributes
    ----------
    type : str
        Card type string. Note that this should be a globally unique name, similar to a
        Python package name, to avoid name clashes between different custom cards.

    Parameters
    ----------
    options : Dict[Any, Any], optional, default None
