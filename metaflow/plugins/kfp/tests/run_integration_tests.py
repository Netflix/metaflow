"""
To run these tests from your terminal, go to the tests directory and run: 
`python -m pytest -s -n 3 run_integration_tests.py`

This script runs all the flows in the `flows` directory. It creates
each kfp run, waits for the run to fully complete, and prints whether
or not the run was successful. It also checks to make sure the logging
functionality works.

More specifically, the tests spawn KFP runs and ensure the spawning processes
have a returncode of 0. If any test fails within KFP, an exception
is raised, the test fails, and the user can access the run link to the failed
KFP run.

Parameters:
-n: specifies the number of parallel processes used by PyTest.

Sometimes, the tests may fail on KFP due to resource quota issues. If they do,
try reducing -n (number of parallel processes) so less simulateneous
KFP runs will be scheduled.
