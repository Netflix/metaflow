# Determine what is the python executable to use for the environment escape. To do this,
# we look for ENV_ESCAPE_PY in the environment AND store it. When metaflow
# is first launched by the user, it is running outside any metaflow created
# environment (like the ones created through the Conda plugin) and we will therefore
# consider that as the environment we escape to.
# Note that it is important to store the value back in the environment to make
# it available to any sub-process that launch as well (ie: when we re-launch WITHIN
# the conda environment).
# We also store the maximum protocol version that we support for pickle so that
# we can determine what to use.
#
# In the case of a bootstrap code (for example on Batch), the subprocess mechanism is
# not used to determine the outside environment but the `generate_trampolines` function
# in this file is called directly by the remote bootstrap code which operates *outside*
# of the created conda environment, so it has the same effect
