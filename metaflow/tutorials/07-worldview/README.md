# Episode 07-worldview: Way up here.

**This episode shows how you can use a notebook to setup a simple dashboard to
monitor all of your Metaflow flows.**

#### Showcasing:
- The Metaflow client API.

##### Before playing this episode:
1. `python -m pip install notebook` (only locally, if you don't have it already)
2. Complete Episode 05 (`HelloCloudFlow`) so that the flow exists in your Metaflow metadata.

If `HelloCloudFlow` has not been executed, you may encounter:
```
MetaflowNotFound: Flow('HelloCloudFlow') does not exist
```
If you are running Metaflow locally without cloud/Kubernetes configuration, you can modify the notebook to inspect locally executed flows such as `HelloFlow` (Episode 00) or `PlayListFlow` (Episode 01).

#### To play this episode:
1. Open ```07-worldview/worldview.ipynb```
