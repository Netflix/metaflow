        Parameters

        Saves blobs of data to the datastore

        The blobs of data are saved as is if raw is True. If raw is False, the
        datastore may process the blobs and they should then only be loaded
        using load_blob

        NOTE: The idea here is that there would be two modes to access
        the file once saved to the datastore:
          - if raw is True, you would be able to access it directly using the
            URI returned; the bytes that are passed in as 'blob' would be
            returned directly by reading the object at that URI. You would also
            be able to access it using load_blob passing the key returned
          - if raw is False, no URI would be returned (the URI would be None)
            and you would only be able to access the object using load_blob.
          - The API also specifically takes a list to allow for parallel writes
            if available in the datastore. We could also make a single
            save_blob' API and save_blobs but this seems superfluous

        Parameters
        ----------
        blobs : List of bytes objects
            Blobs to save. Each blob should be bytes
        raw : bool, optional
            Whether to save the bytes directly or process them, by default False

        Returns
        -------
        List of save_blobs_result:
            The list order is the same as the blobs passed in. The URI will be
            None if raw is False.
