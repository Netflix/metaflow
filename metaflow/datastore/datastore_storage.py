        Parameters
        ----------
        path_and_bytes_iter : Iterator[(string, (RawIOBase|BufferedIOBase, metadata))]
            Iterator over objects to store; the first element in the outermost
            tuple is the path to store the bytes at. The second element in the
            outermost tuple is either a RawIOBase or BufferedIOBase or a tuple
            where the first element is a RawIOBase or BufferedIOBase and the
            second element is a dictionary of metadata to associate with the
            object.
            Keys for the metadata must be ascii only string and elements
            can be anything that can be converted to a string using json.dumps.
            If you have no metadata, you can simply pass a RawIOBase or
